## Description
This app is a book search engine with the ability to save favorite books. The app uses a  GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and built on the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server..

## Installation

```md
1. Download the zip file and copy it to a directory of your choice or clone to a directory of your choice using your terminal.
2. Open the file in VS Code or any editor you prefer.
3. Open the terminal in VS Code and make sure you’re in the correct directory.
4. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/, .env/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.
5. Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.
6. Run npm run develop to start a server and your app.
